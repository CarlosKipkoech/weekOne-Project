            <p>Photographs play an important role in everyone’s life – they connect 
                us to our past, they remind us of people, places, feelings, 
                and stories. They can help us to know who we are. For people 
                who grew up in children’s institutions, photographs are especially important – sadly,
                 this is because for so many people, the photographs most of us take for granted, don’t exist.However,
